Methodology..

In this paper, we explored the Titanic data from Kaggle and five machine learning algorithms namely Linear SVC, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random forests, ANN were implemented to predict survival rate of passengers. Some factors such as "Age", "Gender", "Children" played a key role towards the survival of Passengers. A comparative ana lysis between the s e algorithms were conducted and the models were evaluated by some metrics. Based on the ana lysis and me tri c s evaluation, ANN outperformed other implemented algorithms in this work.

Pre-Processing of data:-

1.Acquire the dataset: Acquiring the dataset is the first step in data preprocessing in machine learning. To build and develop Machine Learning models, you must first acquire the relevant dataset.
2.Import all the crucial libraries: Since Python is the most extensively used and the most preferred library by Data Scientists around the world, we will show you how to import Python libraries for data preprocessing in Machine Learning.
3.Import the dataset: In this step, we need to import the dataset that we have gathered for the ML project at hand.
4.Identifying and handling the missing values
5.Encoding the categorical data
6.Splitting the dataset
7.Feature scaling.

Implement the Best Model:

1.Logistic Regression: predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable. Therefore, the outcome must be a categorical or discrete value. It can be either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or False, etc. but instead of giving the exact value as 0 and 1, it gives the probabilistic values which lie between 0 and 1.

2.Support Vector Machines: The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the new data point in the correct category in the future. This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane.

3.Linear SVC: The objective of a Linear SVC (Support Vector Classifier) is to fit to the data you provide, returning a "best fit" hyperplane that divides, or categorizes, your data. From there, after getting the hyperplane, you can then feed some features to your classifier to see what the "predicted" class is.

4.Random Forest: Random Forest is a classifier that contains several decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset.

Apply the ANN model:-

Artificial neural network (ANN) is a computational model that consists of several processing elements that receive inputs and deliver outputs based on their predefined activation functions.
ANNs are efficient data-driven modelling tools widely used for nonlinear systems dynamic modelling and identification, due to their universal approximation capabilities and flexible structure that allow to capture complex nonlinear behaviors.
